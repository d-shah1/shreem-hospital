                What is Glaucoma?
              </h5>
              <p className="mt-5 text-lg font-source-regular text-greyText leading-relaxed">
                Glaucoma is a group of eye conditions that damage the optic
                nerve, which is vital for good vision. This damage is often
                caused by abnormally high pressure in the eye, also known as
                intraocular pressure. If left untreated, glaucoma can lead to
                permanent vision loss or even blindness. At Shreem Hospital, our
                dedicated team of ophthalmologists is equipped with advanced
                diagnostic tools and treatment options to manage glaucoma
                effectively and preserve your vision.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-5 text-lg font-source-regular text-greyText leading-relaxed">
                At Shreem Hospital, we understand that early detection is key to
