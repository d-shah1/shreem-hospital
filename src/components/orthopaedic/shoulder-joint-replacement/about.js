              Shoulder pain can significantly limit your daily activities, from
              lifting objects to simply reaching for something on a shelf. At
              Shreem Hospital, we understand the challenges that come with
              persistent shoulder discomfort. Shoulder joint replacement surgery
              offers a safe and effective way to restore movement, alleviate
              pain, and improve your quality of life.

                What is Shoulder Joint Replacement Surgery?
              </h5>
              <p className="mt-5 text-lg font-source-regular text-greyText leading-relaxed">
                Shoulder joint replacement surgery involves replacing the
                damaged parts of the shoulder joint with artificial components,
                known as prostheses. The surgery is designed to replicate the
                natural movement of the shoulder, helping patients regain
                mobility and live pain-free lives. This procedure is
                particularly effective for conditions like advanced arthritis,
                severe fractures, or joint degeneration.
