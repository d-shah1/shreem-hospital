              At Shreem Hospital, we understand how debilitating joint pain can
              be. Whether itâ€™s your knees, hips, or other joints, severe
              discomfort can limit your ability to enjoy life fully. This is
              where knee and joint replacement surgery can be a life-changing
              solution.

                What is Joint Replacement Surgery?
              </h5>
              <p className="mt-5 text-lg font-source-regular text-greyText leading-relaxed">
                Joint replacement surgery involves replacing damaged or diseased
                parts of a joint with artificial implants, also known as
                prostheses. These implants are designed to mimic the natural
                movement of your joints, providing relief from pain and
                improving mobility.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-3 text-lg font-source-regular text-greyText leading-relaxed">
                The most common type is knee replacement surgery, which is
                recommended for those suffering from advanced arthritis or
                significant joint damage. Similarly, other joints such as hips,
                shoulders, and elbows can also be replaced to restore
                functionality.
